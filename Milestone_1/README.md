For milestone 1 I wanted to make sure I soldered and wired the bigger screen correctly. 
To make sure it works, I used test code that Adafruit provided to test the touch and the display using the Arduino.

I also programmed a smaller screen on the ATMEGA 1284 which is not touch, and has fewer pins to get familiar with adding a TFT display and programming it with the ATMEGA 1284.
I tested a photoresistor using ADC with the smaller screen which allows the screen to display different strings when a threshold is reached.
