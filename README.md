# 122A Final Project

A Clear LCD Touchscreen Display.


The idea behind this project: 

I feel that clear LCD panels are the future of today's technology. They can be used almost anywhere: replaced by shop windows to advertise their products; replaced by vending machine windows to advertise and use the touchscreen to buy products; or in this case, replace home windows to use use as “smart windows”.

My project is a clear LCD touchscreen panel which is used as a window and also displays the current weather. It let's you know what the current temperature is outside, the current humidity and how sunny it is! But that's not all. It will notify you whether you need to take action based on the values. Is it sunny outside? Wear your suncreen!; Is it cold? Did you wear something warm?; Is the humidity high? Did you take your umbrella? And much more!

The touchscreen is interactive and allows you to check off items if you've remembered.
