For milestone 2, I finally got the bigger screen working on the ATMEGA 1284 using SPI. The only problem is that the touch is a little off.

In addition to the photoresistor from last milestone, I now have working: a temperature sensor using ADC; a vibration sensor with LED.

So far I'm having trouble with getting the humidity sensor to work on the ATMEGA 1284 which uses I2C communication. I got it to work on the Arduino though...
